  </div>
  <div class="mb-10 text-justify">
    Actively engaged as a member of the DIVE Lab at Texas A&M University, specializing in cutting-edge research at the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs), Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and Graph Transformers (GT).
    <br><br>
    Currently, my scholarly pursuits center around unraveling the intricate internal mechanisms of Graph Transformers. My research aims to contribute a comprehensive understanding of how Graph Transformers and Large Language Models interpret and process graph datasets.
    <br><br>
    As part of my master's thesis, I am dedicated to advancing the field and aspire to present my findings at esteemed conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR. My ultimate goal is to contribute valuable insights to the academic community and propel the understanding of these innovative technologies to new heights.
    <br><br>
    As an active participant in DIVE Lab, I regularly deliver engaging seminars on compelling research papers, sharing insights and fostering intellectual discussions within our lab community. Explore some of my recent presentations below.
